Agenda:
0. House Keeping: Cover any issues / concerns for the course.
1. Understanding Basic Database Structures and Design
2. Setting up Firebase in a project
3. Writing Data to Firebase
4. Reading Data from Firebase
5. (last 5 minutes)
    - Review Weekly Project & what students can do to prep now.

Goals: 
- Give students an understanding of SQL v noSQL and let them know why we are using noSQL. Just a basic understanding is required. The important thing is for them to know the difference, know that they won't know anything about SQL, and explain the benefits of noSQL. 
- Students are able to wire up a Firebase project. 
- Students will be able to read and write data to their Firebase project.

Talk abouot data and why databases are important 
    - We have to store info somewhere. 
    - Databases give our projects functional depth. 

SQL and noSQL pros and cons
    - noSQL is faster to start with
    - SQL does better w/ relationships

Why are we using firebase? 
    - Its fast and it scales. 
    - It suits you for the project you will build today as well as the project that you will want to build a year from now. 

Brief discussion of Firebase v Firestore
    - Tell them we aren't using Firestore so they need to watch out for that in the documentation. 

How do we design a database? 
    - objects
    - relationships between objects 
    - good to draw out what our db will look like before we start coding. What will be in each object.
