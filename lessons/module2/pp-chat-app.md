# Practice Problem: Chat App 1.0

## Goal

Our goal for this project is to build a simple, web-based chat app.  Our Chat app will:
- Allow anyone on our website to post a new message.
- Listen for messages posted by others and display them on them on our screen.

At the end of this activity, we will have built something similar to this example or Rick chatting with Morty.

## Overview

Previously, all of the text we displayed in our webpage was hard coded into our HTML document.  While this may work for a static website, it won't work for more sophisticated applications with content that is dynamically generated by users.

When HTTP was invented it was designed as a "stateless protocol", which makes sense as we were mostly using the web to share content such as research papers or pictures of our cats.  However, as the web evolved we started to see more and more sophisticated applications, such as online stores, and this idea of a purely "stateless protocol" became a problem.  For example, we online stores needed to "save" the your cart so that even if you refreshed your browser you would still have the opportunity to buy those items.

To do this, developers came up with a number of different ways to store this "state".  For example, you may have heard of __cookies__ being saved in your web browser; these cookies are simply tiny text files that developers use to store the "state of things" for later.  When a website loads, we can check if a cookie exists and use the data that was stored in it.  Unfortunately, cookies have a major drawback in that they are not very useful if you are using more than one device.

Today, it is not hard to imagine that someone will start shopping on one computer and then finish shopping on their phone.  Cookies won't help us in this scenario because they are not shared between browsers.  Therefore developers needed a new way to store "state", which is where __databases__ come to the rescue.

Looking at this diagram below, you see that both the browser on our phone and the browser on our computer get the data they need for the shopping cart by querying the same shared database.

We will practice the following concepts in this lesson:
* Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
* HTML
* JavaScript
* Firestore Database

## Instructions

### 1. Create a new Firebase project

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/?pli=1
2. Click Create Project
3. Give your project a name, for example: intro-to-webdev-chat-app
4. Disable Google Analytics (we don’t need this yet)
5. Click “Create Project”
6. After a few moments, your project will be created (firebase-1)

![firebase project example]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/module2/firebase-1.png)

### 2. Create a new Firestore database in your Firebase project

1. Click on “Cloud Firestore” in the left hand menu
2. Click “Create Database”
3. Click “Start in Test Mode”, then Next
    1. This creates your database without any user based security, which is fine while we are just getting started.  In 30 days, Firebase will automatically set your data to be private.
4. Set your Cloud Firestore Location to us-central, this is simply where the server is in the world.  Servers closer to your users will be faster!
5. After a few moments your cloud firestorm database will be provisioned!  
6. You should see a screen like this: 

![firebase project example]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/module2/firebase-2.png)

### 3. Create a new Firestore Web Application pointing at your Firestore Database


1. Now we need to register a new Web App with our Firestore Database
2. In the left hand side, click on the gear icon next to “Project Overview” to bring up your project's settings.
3. Scroll down and under `Your Apps`, click on the icon to create a Web App.
4. You will see some starter code to add to your HTML file.  Copy that and use it to create an HTML file that looks like the code below.  Of course, your firebaseConfig = {…} variable should contain the values you copied for your project.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>Simple Chat App</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8"  />
</head>

<body>
    <!-- The core Firebase JS SDK is always required and must be listed first -->
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.2.1/firebase-app.js"></script>
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.2.1/firebase-firestore.js"></script>


     <p>… Your HTML content here …</p>

     <script>
        // Your web app's Firebase configuration
        var firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "Your API Key",
          authDomain: "Your authDomain",
          projectId: "Your project ID",
          storageBucket: "Your Storage Bucket",
          messagingSenderId: "Your Message Sender ID",
          appId: "Your App ID"
        };
        // Initialize Firebase
        firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
      </script>
</body>
</html>
```
#### Try it out
* Save the html and go to your desktop as `chat-app.html` and open it with Chrome (or whatever browser you have).
* You should see our `Chat App` application.
* It should be super boring as we haven't told it what to do yet.

### 4. New Messages
To store the chat messages that are written by users, we'll use our Firestore Database.

To add the functionality for users to write messages to our database, we will create a new function called `saveMessage()`

Because we have already initialized firebase using our web app's credentials, we can easily reference to our database as: `firebase.firestore`.  To make our code easier to read, we will create a new connivence variable called `db` that we set equal to `firebase.firestore`

Recall that in Firestore, our database is simply a collection of documents.  W

For our chat application, we only need one collection, let's call it `messages`.

```db.collection('messages')```

Once we have our collection, we want to add a document to that.  There are several ways to create a new document inside of a collection, which is documented here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data.

Every document in our collection has to have a meaningful ID that identifies it, and in the case of our chat application it's more convenient to let Cloud Firestore auto-generate that ID for us. As the documentation points out, this can done for us by calling add().  add() takes one argument, which is a dictionary of keys and values. 

```
// A dictionary with key:value pairs.  The key is the field name in our document and the value is what it's set to.
new_message = {
    username: "Rick",
    text: "You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?"
}

db.collection('messages').add(new_message)
```

#### Try it out
* Reload your updated `chat-app.html` in your browser.
* Type in a user name and a message and click "send".
* In another tab, open your firebase console and click on Firestore.
* You should see a new collection, called 'messages', with one or more documents that reflect your messages!

Sadly, no messages show up yet in our webpage.  That is because we have to tell our client-side code to listen for new messages from the database.  Let's do that next.

### 5. Synchronize messages
While we have 
To read messages in the app, we'll need to add listeners that trigger when data changes and then create a UI element that shows new messages.

We'll add code that listens for newly added messages from the app. In this code, we'll register the listener that listens for changes made to the data. We'll only display the last 12 messages of the chat to avoid displaying a very long history upon loading.

Go back to the file public/scripts/main.js.
Find the function loadMessages.
Replace the entire function with the following code.
* Right-Click and download the following images 
* Save them in a new sub-folder, `imgs`, in your `quidditch-cup` project directory.

Quaffle            |  Golden Snitch

### 3. Make the `New Game` Button Work

Now we will add some JavaScript to start our game when the user clicks the `new game` button.

For each step below, write your code between the `<script></script>` tags in our index.html file.
* Define a variable, called _score_, and initialize it to 0.
  * We will use this to track the score for our player.

<div class="hint">Hover for hint</div>

{: .hint-content}
```
<script>
  var score = 0;
</script>
```
