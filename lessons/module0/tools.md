# Tools
In this course, we will be using a variety of toools that will help us as we progress in our coding knowledge. Some of these are tools you will be familiar with, and some might be new to you. This section is to give you a little bit of information about some of the main tools we will be using and what they do.

# Slack 
Slack is a messaging tool that will allow you to ask and answer questions along the way. Instructors will be in Slack along with your fellow class mates from all three sections of this course. It will be a great resource for you to ask for help from your peers if you get stuck. 

You will receive access to Slack before the class begins via an email invite. If you have not yet received your Slack invite before reading this, please email alex@southbendcodeschool.com for help. 

Slack is pretty intuitive, but if you feel like you want some additional info before jumping in, check out this [article on how to use Slack.](https://slack.com/resources/slack-101/find-and-start-conversations)

# Google Chrome
If you are using another browser, now is the time to learn the power of Chrome! 

Chrome is the best browser for developers because it comes with a bunch of cool developer tools that will help us build better web applications. Don't worry about learning about those right now. We will dive deeper later.

# GitHub
GitHub is a great tool for saving your code online, keeping track of versions, and collaborating with others. Don't worry too much about GitHub just yet. We'll get more into it later.
