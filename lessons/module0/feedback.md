# Feedback

There is no grade for this course! 

Each week, students will submit their code to their instructor demonstrating skills learned. Students will receive weekly feedback from their instructor in the form of comments to their code through the software development and version control tool, GitHub. Students will receive direct feedback from their peers and instructor during weekly labs and updates from their instructor through routine email and Slack communications regarding project progress. At the end of the course, students will receive a completed rubric from their instructor reviewing project completeness and suggestions for continued development, should the student decide to continue working on the project on their own.

At the end of this course, each student will have a portfolio of work that can be used on resumes or during the job application process.

Ugh, you guys...I had a really difficult time choosing between two memes because one is Gandalf, which I mean c'mon, he's Gandalf, but the other is about the Matrix and we're freaking coding! Life can be so hard sometimes.
