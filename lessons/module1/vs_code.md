# Introduction to Visual Studio Code

## Overview
Visual Studio Code (vscode) is a light weight and free text editor built for software developers.

## Why you should care
- Visual Studio Code is very flexible and it can be used to write programs in any langauge.  In this course we will focus on:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
- It is highly extensible and open source, making it *extremely* popular with professional software developers.
- It provides many advantages over basic text editors, for example:
  - Syntax Highlighting to make code easier to read
  - Autocompletion and Type-ahead support
  - Provides you the ability to preview your work

## Usage

In this course, we will develop our code using Visual Studio Code.  In addition, we will organize our code in **project** folders, which will helps us keep our code organized and tidy.  A project folder will contain all of the necessary files for the project's website.

Visual studio makes it easy to create and work on **projects**:
1. Make a new folder on your computer using Windows Explorer or the Finder for MacOS and give it a your project title.
2. From Visual Studio Code, select File->Open
3. Browse to your project folder, and then click "open".

4. You will see all of the files you've created for your project on the left hand side-bar.

5. You can view the code for any file on the right hand side.

## Happy Editing!
