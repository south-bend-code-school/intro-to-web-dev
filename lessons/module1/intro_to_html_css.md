# Intro to HTML and CSS

## Goal

At the end of this prework, the goal is to have an understanding of HTML, CSS, and how to combine the two to create and style a webpage.

## Overview

HTML and CSS are two coding languages that are essential to building webpages. Imagine that instead of a webpage, we were building a house. A house needs a **structure** (walls, roof, foundation), **design** (layout, decoration), and **functionality** (plumbing, electricity). For a website, HTML is used to build the **structure** and CSS is used to **design**. The **functionality** is a different language which will be covered later.

## Resources

Use these resources to introduce yourself to the topics and to complete the exercises.

### HTML

The following guide will introduce you to HTML. It may seem a little daunting at first since you may not understand the terminology, but do not worry. It is totally okay if some things are still unclear to you, just keep pressing through and these concepts will make sense in time.

### CSS

These guides will build on top of what you learned about HTML to teach you CSS which is used to layout and decorate your HTML. Again, if not everything is clear, do not worry! Just try to have enough understanding to complete the exercises.
