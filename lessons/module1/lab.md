- Explain How Lab will go

Encouragement 
- This is hard stuff. You're doing great!

- Set expectations for time in breakout rooms.
  - you will share screens and code and talk about where you're at and what you're struggling with. 
  - ex: my virtual pet is the lochness monster and here are my images here is what doesn't work. Here is what I'm struggling with. 
  - if they don't have anything to share they should work independently and work together to solve problems. Don't leave if you aren't sure what to do.
  - if you are done, let me know and so we can review your code
  - if someone is done, go ahead and let them know they should stay on and help
