## Quidditch 2.0 Instructions
In the second half of this live session you will break into small groups and individually enhance Quiddtich 1.0 in the following ways:

### Features for 2.0:

1. Add the Golden Snitch.
    * Clicking the golden snitch earns 150 points AND ends the game.
    * The Snitch should be smaller than the actual image size, 32x32 px.  Use CSS to accomplish this.
    * The Snitch should be faster than the quaffle.

2. Add a time limit to the game
    * Automatically End the Game after 15 seconds.
    * Show the time remaining in the game on the screen.

3. Add a background soundtrack to the game
    * Use the HTML5 Audio Tag

Your final game should look like this:
