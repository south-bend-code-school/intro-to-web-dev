## Usage

In this course, we will develop all of our code using Visual Studio Code.  We will also organize our code into **projects**.  

Visual studio makes it easy to create and work on **projects**:
1. Make a new project folder on your computer using Windows Explorer or the Finder for MacOS.
2. From Visual Studio Code, select File->Open
3. Browse to your project folder, and then click "open".
