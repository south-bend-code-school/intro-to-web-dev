# Introduction to Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a light weight and free text editor built for software developers.

## Why you should care
- Visual Studio Code is very flexible and it can be used to write programs in any langauge.  In this course we will focus on:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
- It is highly extensible and open source, making it *extremely* popular with professional software developers.
- It provides many advantages over basic text editors, for example:
  - Syntax Highlighting to make code easier to read
  - Autocompletion and Typeahead support
  - Provides you the ability to preview your work

## Usage

In this course, we will develop all of our code using Visual Studio Code.  We will also organize our code into **projects**, which helps us keep our code organized and tidy.  In our case, a project is simply a folder with all of the necessary files for our website.

Visual studio makes it easy to create and work on **projects**:
1. Make a new project folder on your computer using Windows Explorer or the Finder for MacOS.
2. From Visual Studio Code, select File->Open
3. Browse to your project folder, and then click "open".
