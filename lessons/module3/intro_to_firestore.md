## Intro to Firestore

Now that you have setup your very own Firestore instance, it would be pretty cool if we learned how to actually us it.  Thankfully Google has put together a number of helpful getting started videos.  Skim through these to get a deeper understanding of how Firebase works.  It's okay if you don't follow everything just yet, we'll work through it bit by bit.

### Conclusion

At this point, you should have a basic understanding of Google's Firestore database. Next, we will use our database to build a simple application to help us determine if a hotdog is, in fact, a sandwich.
