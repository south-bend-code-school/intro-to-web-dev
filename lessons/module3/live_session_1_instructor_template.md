Agenda:
0. House Keeping: Cover any issues / concerns for the course.
1. Understanding the "back end" and Serverless Architecture
2. Adding Firebase Functions to projects
3. Node Modules
5. (last 5 minutes)
    - Review Weekly Project & what students can do to prep now.

Goals: 
- Students are able to build projects using Firebase functions
- Students are able to articulate what serverless architecture is and how it is relevant. 
- Students understand what Node.js is, how it is relevant to their projects, what Node Modules are, what Node Modules do for their projects, and how Node.js in general relates to their firebase projects.

Explain the relevance of back end logic
    - Sometimes you need to manipulate data as your database ingests it. 
    - Sometimes you want to run logic that isn't pretty for a front end user experience. 

The old way of doinig this, the new way, and firebase functions
    - People used to have to write entire back ends for their web apps, and sometimes still do, but there is a much friendlier way to do this now. Enter, Firebase Functions. 
    - FIrebase gives us these cool tools that allow us to use a GUI to set up more of our web appliciations and we will take advantage of that by using Firebase Functions.

(Students should have read about Firebase Functions before getting here.)

Setup
- Walk thru setting up Firebase functions in your project. 
- Walk thru of how to test Firebase functions on your localhost. 
- Firebase functiions code example.

What is Node? 
What are Node Modules? 
How does all of this relate to Firebase and Firebase Functions? 

* Note - This stuff abt Node Modules might come into play earlier than this live session. Not sure.
