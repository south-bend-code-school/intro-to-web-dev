<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>Students participating in this program will gain experience using tools and methods that are used in professional settings. They will also develop a portfolio of work that will adequately demonstrate the relevancy of their knowledge and skills to potential employers. This program will also be beneficial to students who are considering the further pursuit of knowledge in computer science and related fields of technology.</p>

<h2 id="course-structure">Course Structure</h2>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>This course is broken down into three modules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Module 1 - Fundamentals of Web Development</li>

  <li>Module 3 - Back End Development</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>
<p>Each week has the same flow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pre-class material released</li>
  <li>Practice problems due</li>

<ol>
  <li>Review the pre-class material for each topic</li>
  <li>Complete and submit the practice problems.</li>
  <li>Download the live session code templates.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="practice-problems">Practice Problems</h3>
<p>Each concept that is presented offers several practice problems that are their to help you evaluate your grasp on the material prior to the Live Sessions.  Solutions are available for all practice problems so that you can check your work and compare your solution to the instructors.</p>

<h3 id="live-sessions">Live Sessions</h3>
<p>In the live sessions, you will apply and discuss the various concepts covered in each module.  Each live session is a mix of instructor lead development and individual/small group coding/debugging challenges.  Durning these sessions we will compare and contrast our solutions work together to become strong web developers, active participation is not simply <strong>highly</strong> encouraged, itâ€™s a necessary part of learning to program effectively.</p>
