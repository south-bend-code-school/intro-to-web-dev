<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>At the end of this prework, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe why GIT and GitHub.com are two of the most important tools for helping developers track changes to and colloborate on code.</li>
  <li>Use the basic and most important commands such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git status</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code> and more!</li>
  <li>Save your code to your remote repostiory on github.com.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throught this course we will us git and github in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use git to track changes to all of your code for our class assignments.</li>
  <li>Use git &amp; github.com to colloborate on group projects with your classmates.</li>
  <li>Share a portfolio of completed projects on your public github.com profile.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p><strong>GIT</strong> is a distributed version control system that is used by the overwheliming majority of professional developers.  GIT tracks changes to your code so that it‚Äôs easy to identify what code has changed from one version to another.</p>

<p>Have you ever worked on a large term paper and needed to save multipe versions? If you‚Äôve ever lost important work because you accidently deleted or overwrote hours of work you understand why tracking changes to your work is so important!</p>

<p>Below is a screenshot comparing two versions of the same webpage. With git can easily see what code was changed between your previous and working version of the code!
<img src="/imgs/module1/git_compare.png" alt="comparing two versions of the same page" /></p>

<p><strong>GITHUB.COM</strong> is a website that can host your git project repositories on the web, making it easy to colloborate with other developers.</p>

<p>Imagine if we were forced to colloborate on that term paper with dozens of other students! We would need a way to safely merge everyone‚Äôs contributions to our paper together while maintaining the integrity of the term paper. Github.com helps to solve this problem by enabling teams of developers track changes and colloborate using centralized project repositorys.</p>

<p>Recall that git is a <em>distributed</em> version controll system. It‚Äôs distributed because every developer working on a project has a complete copy of the project and all changes on their local computer (known as the project repository). All of these developers periodically sync their work and changes to this centralized, remote repository, hosted on github.com.</p>

<h3 id="git-crash-course">GIT Crash Course</h3>

<p>The following video will walk you through the basics of GIT and Github. his video closely mirrors your pre-work exercise below. This video is a little long and fairly dense, so you might want to get a cup of coffee while you watch it!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc"><img src="http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/SWYqp7iY_Tc/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Git &amp; GitHub Crash Course For Beginners" /></a></p>

<p>GIT is very robust and as such the number of commands and features may seem a little overwhelming at first, but do not worry. It is totally okay if some things are still unclear to you, just keep pressing through and these concepts will make sense as we apply them throughout the course.</p>
