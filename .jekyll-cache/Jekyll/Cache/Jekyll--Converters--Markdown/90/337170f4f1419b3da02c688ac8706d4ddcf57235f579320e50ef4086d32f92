<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>By the end of this lesson, you should have an understanding of how to use JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS to create webpages.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Earlier, we used an analogy of a house to describe the purposes of HTML and CSS. HTML is structure (walls, roof, foundation) and CSS is design (layout, decoration). But, if we are building a house, how do we get the functionality (electricity, plumbing, etc.)? The answer is JavaScript (JS). JS allows us to store data in databases, get data from other sites, change whatâ€™s in the HTML and CSS, and much more. While just HTML and CSS may be fine for a website that simply exists to show information such as contact information or hours of business, anything more interesting than this will require JS.</p>
