<p>At the end of this practice problem, you should have created the card playing elements of the game of blackjack.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The game of blackjack is a gambling card game where players compete against a dealer to try to get closest to 21 without going over. While blackjack includes gambling and the exchange of chips, we wonâ€™t focus on that today. We simply want to do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a deck of 52 cards</li>
  <li>Mimic shuffling</li>
  <li>Deal 2 cards to both dealer and player</li>
  <li>Show cards on screen</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
