<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>At the end of this prework, the goal is to have an understanding of what a <strong>function</strong> is and how to use them in JavaScript.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Now that you understand variables and conditionals, we will move onto a very helpful concept in JS called <strong>functions</strong>. A <strong>function</strong> is a set of instructions that can be called from other parts of the code. Imagine (unless you don’t need to) you own an Amazon Echo (this is not an ad for Amazon Echo, I promise). An Echo can be used for searches, music, and more. One thing you can do with an Echo is program eletric outlets to be controlled with your voice. An example of this would be you can say “Alexa, Merry Christmas” and all of the outlets that are associated with Christmas lights are turned on. Or you can say, “Alexa, good night.” and all the lights in the room shut off. This is how functions work! You create the function one time (e.g. configuring all outlets to turn off) and then you can call that function (e.g. “Alexa, good night.”) every night before bed. Functions are critical to functional websites which we will be able to see below.</p>

<h3 id="functions-introduction">Functions: Introduction</h3>

<p>Earlier, we said that many things can be the value of a variable. We saw that number (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var num = 5</code>) and strings (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var str = "wow"</code>) can be the value of variables. On top of those, <strong>functions</strong> can also be the value of variables. Let’s look at an example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var addTwoNumbers = (num1, num2) =&gt; {
  var sum = num1 + num2
  return sum
}

var total = addTwoNumbers(1, 2)

// value of total is 3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, there is a decent amount going on above. If the code above were an English sentence, the first 4 lines would read like this: <em>First, I make a function called addTwoNumbers because it will add 2 numbers. I will call those numbers <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num2</code>. I will add those 2 numbers together and call it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sum</code>. Then, I will <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sum</code> to wherever is calling this function.</em></p>

<p>The 6th line of code above (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var total = addTwoNumbers(1, 2)</code>) would read like this: <em>I am going to call the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addTwoNumbers</code>. Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addTwoNumbers</code> requires that I pass it 2 numbers, I will pass it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code>. Whatever the function returns, I will put in a variable called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">total</code>.</em></p>

<p>Now that we know what is generally going on, let’s get into the anatomy of a function.</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(num1, num2)</code>
    <ul>
      <li>The first part of any function is going to declaring your <strong>parameters</strong> which in this case are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num2</code>. Parameters are be surrounded by parantheses and have commas in between individual parameters. You can see that we start the function with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(num1, num2)</code> and then use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num2</code> in the next line by adding them together and setting that sum equal to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sum</code>, (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var sum = num1 + num2</code>). Parameters allow us to take in values into our function and use them even though we don’t know exactly what those values will be.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=&gt; {}</code>
    <ul>
      <li>After the parameters, we use the arrow, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=&gt;</code>, to indicate we are starting the part of the function that will use the <strong>parameters</strong> to do something. All of this code that does stuff with the <strong>parameters</strong> should go between curly brackets, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{}</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Function body
    <ul>
      <li>In between those curly brackets are 2 lines of code, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var sum = num1 + num2</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return sum</code>. The first line is pretty simple, it is simply declaring a variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sum</code> and then setting it equal to the addtion of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num2</code>. The next line however, isn’t so clear. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> is a keyword in JavaScript (and several other languages) that allows functions to not only do things (e.g. add 2 numbers together) but to also return values to wherever the function is being called. Without the line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return sum</code>, the function would add 2 numbers together, put that value in the variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sum</code>, and that would be it. We couldn’t use the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sum</code> outside of the function. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> allows us to get values out of a function after the work of the function is done.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now you understand some of the basic concepts behind HTML and CSS! Hopefully this meme makes a little more sense to you than it did before you started.</p>
