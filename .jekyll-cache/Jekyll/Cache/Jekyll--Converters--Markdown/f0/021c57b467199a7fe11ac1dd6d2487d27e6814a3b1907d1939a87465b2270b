<p>This course is 3 weeks long. During each week, we will cover one module of the curriculum. These modules will consist of the followingâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="prework">Prework</h2>
<p>Prework will consist of information and exercises that will be helpful to your learning experience in tandem with the live sessions. It is expected that you complete each prework section before attending the corresponding live session. If there are sections of the prework that present difficulty to you, donâ€™t worry! We can talk about problems in the Slack team for this course or during the live session. Just do the best you can for each prework section.</p>

<h2 id="practice-problems">Practice Problems</h2>
<p>Practice problems will help you apply the concepts we are learning to challenges or projects. These problems will take place during the prework, but will be covered in varying degrees during our live sessions. Please keep in mind that the live session might not be able to cover the entirety of each practice problem, so it is still very important that you attempt these before each live session.</p>

<p>These practice problems are designed to be challenging and expose you to new coding concepts. It isnâ€™t important that every solution you develop to be perfect. Instead, we are looking for you to dig into the problem, develop the best solution you can, articulate the areas in which you had difficulty, and communicate where you feel you are getting stuck.</p>

<p>These practice problems will also be added to your portfolio of work.</p>

<h2 id="live-session">Live Session</h2>
<p>Live sessions will be where we work together to develop comprehension around key coding concepts. During these sessions, you will be coding together with an instructor and discussing key coding concepts.</p>

<p>Live sessions occur twice per week.</p>

<h2 id="labs">Labs</h2>
<p>During labs you will work in small groups to develop weekly projects.</p>

<p>Labs will occur once per week.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>You will be expected to turn in your various projects from throughout the week. All practice problems and larger projects will be submitted at 11:59pm on Thursday. These projects will be submitted by committing your code to GitHub (donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t know what that is yet). Instructors will review your project code and provide feedback to you by the start of the following week.</p>

<h2 id="a-note">A Note</h2>
<p>Learning how to code can be a very rewarding experience, but it is also challenging. There will be times when you feel frustrated or lost, and we want you to know that is okay. There will also be parts of the learning process where you feel like you just donâ€™t get it but it seems like everyone around you does. That is okay, too!</p>

<p>Everyone has different hangups when it comes to learning how to code. Some people have a difficult time with JavaScript, others will have a difficult time understanding how GitHub works, and others will have a very difficult time understanding databases. Code is a vast world and different parts of it sync well with different people.</p>

<p>This course will move fairly quickly and there are times when you might feel like you just donâ€™t get it. Hang in there, ask questions, and use the resources we provide as well as the internet at large.</p>
