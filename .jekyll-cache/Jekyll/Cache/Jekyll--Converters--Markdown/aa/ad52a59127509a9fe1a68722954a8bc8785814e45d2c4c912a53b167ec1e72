<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>At the end of this practice problem, you should have created the card playing elements of the game of blackjack.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The game of blackjack is a gambling card game where players compete against a dealer to try to get closest to 21 without going over. While blackjack includes gambling and the exchange of chips, we wonâ€™t focus on that today. We simply want to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a deck of 52 cards</li>
  <li>Mimic shuffling</li>
  <li>Deal 2 cards to both dealer and player</li>
  <li>Show cards on screen</li>
  <li>Declare winner and restart</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>In order to start your page, you will need a new folder and a new file. Go to your desktop and create a new folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blackjack</code>. Then, open up VS Code and create a new file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> and save it inside of your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blackjack</code> folder.</p>

<p>As always, you need to start will the bare bones of a website which is this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;

    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    Hello world!
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;

  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After copying and pasting that into the file, go to the folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blackjack</code> on you desktop, open it, right-click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>, and choose to open in your browser. Confirm that you can see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hello world!</code>. If so, you are ready to get started.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-deck">Creating a deck</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s start by creating a deck of cards in JavaScript. A deck has 52 cards which are made up of 4 suits with 13 values within each suit. There are several ways we could represent this deck of cards in JS. For our purposes, I believe the easiest way for us to represent the deck is to use both an <strong>arrays</strong> and <strong>objects</strong>. Each individual card will be an <strong>object</strong> with 2 <strong>key</strong>/<strong>value</strong> pairs, the <strong>suit</strong> and the <strong>value</strong>. We are going to create a <strong>object</strong> for each card and then put all 52 cards into an array</p>
