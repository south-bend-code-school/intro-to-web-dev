TODO: This live session also has a lot of wiggle room that we can adjust for once we know a little more about where we are at with the learning objectives for the course. We need to cover API's somewhere in here, but the DNS stuff can shift and adjust. There might be some more powerful stuff to learn like authentication or something like that.
